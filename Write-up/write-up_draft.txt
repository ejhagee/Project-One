1. How has travel numbers changed over time? (Regional distribution changed over months or years?)
    Travel has nearly doubled since 1996, however some regions have shown more of a change than others. The Middle East and Central America have shown a highly upward trend over time, while South America and Oceania have lagged behind other areas in growth. 
    
2. What may make people travel during certain periods of time?
    Travel patterns reveal themselves in monthly charts. There are spikes for travel in March potentially due to carnival/spring break. The summer months are the busiest, likely due to the pleasant weather and kids being out of school. September shows a downwards trend for the carribean and mexican regions, perhaps owing to the hurricane season. December has a noticeable spike as well, most likely because of the holidays and time from work. 
    
3. What's the most popular travel destination and the least favorable destination according to the travel trends in the past 20 years?
    Europe is by far the most popular travel destination. Mexico and the Carribean alternate between second and third place fairly often. The least traveled to region appears to be Africa. 
    
4. How the change of economy affect people's purchasing power on traveling overseas?
    The amount of outbound visitors appears to be inversely linked to the unemployment rate. Travel spending has made an upward trajectory overall, suffering only slight setbacks after 9/11 and the recession in 2008.
    
5. The change on travel numbers during a major historical event/natual disarster/ political crisis.
    It is difficult to describe the impact of a major historical event on the data that we have. We can not conclusively say that events such as 9/11 have impacted the travel data, while at the same time discounting the recession around that time and its impact on travel tourism and the economy.
