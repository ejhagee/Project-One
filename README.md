# Project-One
A Collaborative Data Visualization Project


# Project Proposal
Our project is to look into U.S. citizens travel trends to international overseas regions from the last 20 years (1996 -2017). We will consider variables such as year and time of year which will lead into other factors such as weather and US economic climate.  Further investigation will proceed into observable trends.

# Questions to Ask of Our Data
1. How has travel numbers changed over time? (Regional distribution changed over months or years?)
2. What may make people travel during certain periods of time?
3. what's the most popular travel destination and the least favorable destination according to the travel trends in the past 20 years? 
4. How the change of economy affect people's purchasing power on traveling overseas?
5. How income affect your travel decision？ （similiar to question #4) 
6. The change on travel numbers during a major historical event/natual disarster/ political crisis.
