# Project-One
A Collaborative Data Visualization Project


# Project Proposal
Our project is to look into U.S. citizens travel trends to international overseas regions from the last 20 years (1996 -2017). We will consider variables such as year and time of year which will lead into other factors such as weather and US economic climate.  Further investigation will proceed into observable trends.
